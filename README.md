# energymodel-libraries
Small collection of libraries to help me utilize both OpenStudio and Trane Trace 3D templates, standards and other libaries.

This is related to creating building energy modeling and heat load models.

A more complete collection of data can be on the OpenStudio Standards GitHub page. It includes a google sheet for perusing different building types.
