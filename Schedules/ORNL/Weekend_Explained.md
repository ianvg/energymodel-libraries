The 2024 Oak Ridge National Laboratory Study did not address weekends, however the DOE Prototype Building for Secondary Schools listed weekends as 0. I have a suspicion that a typical college building will have some measure of occupancy on the weekends.

However to be consistent, I will mark the weekends as unoccupied for the college spaces.
